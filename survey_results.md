#Zephyr research results
##survey results via Google survey

###Hypothesis
Austin's bicycle commuting population is prevented from growing due to issues with safety and cyclist/motorist interaction.

###Overview
Part of the research for this project was to survey people and see if there is an interest in commuting on a bicycle, and why or why not they do. I created a quick survey using Google Forms that split up my sample into two groups; one for bicycle commuters, and one for non-bicycle commuters. After the split, a set of questions was asked to each group to identify specifics. The following are observations and data based on the survey and a sample size of 24 participants.

###Base percentages

Of the 24 people surveyed, 2 (8.3%) commute by bicycle. This is significantly larger than the ~1.5% of Austin's total population. A small sample size and the sample demographic (my friends, Austin tech/startup sector) effected those numbers.

100% of the 2 bicycle commuters surveyed commute 1-3 days a week with an average one-way distance of 2 miles.

22 (91.7%) users surveyed do not commute by bicycle. Interestingly 16 (69.6%) of these 22 do own a bike that could be used for transportation.
