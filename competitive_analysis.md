###Ride the City - iOS/web/android
Ride the City's app provides the same core concept of safe route directions for bicycle commuters. The general build is built off google maps with custom layers and icons and doesn't give the experience of of a custom built tool. Data appears to be a mix of google maps bicycle routing, crowd sourcing, and possibly some proprietary data. There is a lot of opportunity to improve the social aspect and the overall UI/UX. Additionally, there is a lack of transparency communicating how the routes are chosen.

####takeaways
- +similarly designed to provide a safe route
- +layer of local bike shop locations
- -poor UI
- -lack of transparency

###Strava - iOS/android - web for data analysis
Strava is arguably the most widely used cycling app on the market. It is free with an optional monthly cost that will unlock additional features. While Strava can be used for commuting, it is designed for recreational use and does not have a routing feature - only a tracking feature. Because it is recreational and doesn't provide a route, it doesn't take road hazards or other obstacles into consideration.

####takeaways
- +excellent tracking metrics
- +clean interface with minimal color usage
- +live ride display is solid
- +effective use of the social aspect
- -doesn't provide routing

###Google Maps - iOS/web/android
The Maps app from Google is very well known and commonly used. The UI can be a bit cluttered and difficult to use at a glance, and the routing [for Austin] doesn't consider dangerous intersections/poorly designed bike lanes/steep & unnecessary climbs. There's a lot to improve upon here.

####takeaways
- +one of the top choices for a map database
- +great search feature
- -bicycle routing leaves a lot to be desired
- -UI elements are small and difficult to use - would be difficult on a bike
