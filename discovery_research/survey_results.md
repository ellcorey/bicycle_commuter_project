#Zephyr research results
##survey results via Google survey

###Hypothesis
Austin's bicycle commuting population is prevented from growing due to issues with safety and cyclist/motorist interaction.

###Overview
Part of the research for this project was to survey people and see if there is an interest in commuting on a bicycle, and why or why not they do. I created a quick survey using Google Forms that split up my sample into two groups; one for bicycle commuters, and one for non-bicycle commuters. After the split, a set of questions was asked to each group to identify specifics. The following are observations and data based on the survey and a sample size of 24 participants.

###By the numbers

Of the 24 people surveyed, 2 (8.3%) commute by bicycle. This is significantly larger than the ~1.5% of Austin's total population. A small sample size and the sample demographic (my friends, Austin tech/startup sector) effected those numbers.

100% of the 2 bicycle commuters surveyed commute 1-3 days a week with an average one-way distance of 2 miles.

22 (91.7%) users surveyed do not commute by bicycle. Interestingly 16 (69.6%) of these 22 do own a bike that could be used for transportation.

Of those who don't commute by bicycle, 21 (95.5%) believe there are positive benefits from bicycle commuting other than physical, and could see themselves commuting by bicycle if deterrents were removed.

###Deterrents
Deterrents were listed by all those who don't currently commute on a bicycle. The range of deterrents listed covered a wide range of reasons commonly listed when the topic of bicycles as transit comes up. The full list is below, but the three most most mentioned were issues with traffic and safety, distance, and weather (dealing with Austin's notoriously hot summers).

####list of deterrents and number of mentions
- safety/Traffic: 11
- distance: 8
- weather: 5
- travel time: 2
- geography: 2
- cost of bike (& gear): 2
- work from home: 2
- bike storage/security: 1
- road disrepair/debris: 1
- carrying associated gear/daily items: 1
- too close: 1

###Additional findings
Open ended questions played a large part in this survey. I was able to collect honest information I believe could be beneficial to the end product.

The 2 bicycle commuters listed reasons for riding a bicycle with one stating, "To avoid the hassle of finding and paying for parking.", and the other listing several reasons, "Exercise, eco-consciousness, live too close to drive a car all the time." They mostly seemed to overcome some of the deterrents listed by those who don't bicycle commute, but had a little more insight, specifically into the poor infrastructure decisions that Austin has made regarding bike lanes that disappear at random and may or may not reappear a block or two later. One mentioned a dire need for Austin motorists to be more educated on the rights, legalities, and respect of cyclists â€” a common issue in the Austin cycling community.

Both sections of the survey offered a space for additional thoughts. The above paragraph includes those of the 2 bicycle commuters. The people who said they do not currently commute by bicycle again listed a range of thoughts. Infrastructure comes up as well as motorist carelessness, but the most common thought was regarding routing.

###Summary
I believe that the data from this (small) sample shows that Austin could grow its bicycle commuting population with proper routing and location of bicycle related amenities such as showers and bike locks.
